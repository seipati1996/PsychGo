<media:description>There’s actually a lot of overlap between laziness and burnout that can make it difficult to differentiate between the two.

Have you ever wonder about the differences between burnout and depression?

It’s an insulting and negative trait. It’s a voluntary, purposeful decision to not act - despite being perfectly capable and in favorable circumstances to do so – often for petty and selfish reasons. Emotional exhaustion is not voluntary, it can be disabling and it can’t just be ‘turned off’. It’s one of the signs of burnout, involving your psyche and emotions feeling like a deflated scrapyard tire. How can you tell it’s Emotional Exhaustion?

<media:description>You're not lazy. You're just mentally exhausted or burnout. Share this video if you agree. With society becoming more fast-paced and productive, people are starting to normalize the habit of overworking. Because of this, people tend to confuse “mental exhaustion” with “laziness” since they both look similar on the surface level. This video might help you remember why it's important to take a break without feeling guilty. DISCLAIMER: This video is for educational purposes and is based on personal opinions.
